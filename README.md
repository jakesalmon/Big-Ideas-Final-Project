# Big-Ideas-Final-Project
## Carmen Campagna and Jacob Salmon

We are using Python and the Pandas library to quantitatively analyze the 'best' neighborhood in Pittsburgh. The datasets we will be using are Pittsburgh's arrest rate records, Pittsburgh's COVID rates, and the Pittsburgh 311 reports. Our metrics will be COVID cases compared to increases in property value, arrest rates, and 311 report rates.

Abstract
- Our findings indicated that Shadyside was the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Shadyside scored the second best in COVID cases/property value and arrest rates, and the best in 311 reports. Our combined metric was a simple scoring system in which we assigned each ranking a score for each of the three categories and summed these scores to find an overall metric. We weighed each of the three metrics evenly in calculating our overall score.
